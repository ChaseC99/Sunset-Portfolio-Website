# [Sunset-Portfolio-Website](https://chasec99.github.io/Sunset-Portfolio-Website/)
A website consisting of some of my best sunset pictures!

This is the first website I ever made. It is a portfolio of some of my best sunset pictures.  
Click [here](https://chasec99.github.io/Sunset-Portfolio-Website/) to see the site!

### The Website
This website is a simple site consisting of 3 tabs.
  - [Portfolio](https://chasec99.github.io/Sunset-Portfolio-Website/)
    - A gallery of my sunset pictures.  
  - [About](https://chasec99.github.io/Sunset-Portfolio-Website/about.html)
    - A profile picture of me and a short bio about my photography.
  - [Social Media](https://chasec99.github.io/Sunset-Portfolio-Website/socialMedia.html)
    - Links to some of my social media accounts.

The website incorporates responsive web design. This means that the website will change its layout depending on the screen size.

In the future, I will continue to update the website with new sunset pictures.
